The Open Skills Project is a public-private partnership lead by the University of Chicago focused on providing a dynamic, up-to-date, locally-relevant, and normalized taxonomy of skills and jobs that builds on and expands on the Department of Labor's O*NET data resources. It's aim is to improve our understanding of the labor market and reduce frictions in the workforce data ecosystem by enabling a more granualr common language of skills among industry, academia, government, and nonprofit organizations.
