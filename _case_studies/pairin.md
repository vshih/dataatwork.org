## What is Pairin?

[Pairin](https://pairin.io/) is a software solution that helps job seekers and employers use soft skills to match individuals with jobs that match their stengths.

## What are the challenges you face working with skils data?

Standard skills data was not granular enough and did not include enough soft skills for Pairin's use case.

## How are you working with the Data at Work API?

Pairin uses the Data at Work API to get standard skills and relevance scores based on job titles.
