title: Get Involved
---

Data at Work is a major project of [the University of Chicago's Center for Data Science and Public Policy](https://dsapp.uchicago.edu), the Department of Labor, the National Skills Coalition, and a large set of community stakeholders.  Community building continues to be a core component of the project: *anyone can get involved and contributions are very welcome*.

In order to make creating, using, and sharing workforce data as easy and frictionless as possible, we need *concrete use cases* and *feedback* from people working across government, industry, and academia:

- Are you a researcher that needs specific [skills data](/data/) or [tools](/tools) to do your work more effectively?  
- Are you a developer working on an application to help people find jobs that our [standards](/standards/) should support?

Let us know. We’d love to hear about it. For examples of data that's already been made available, see the [data](/data/) page. For examples of what has already been built, see the [tools](/tools/) page.  For information on where we’re going, see our [roadmap](/roadmap/).

## Working Groups

### Open Skills Data Cooperative

Partners contribute data to the cooperative, benefitting not only from the rich, dynamic insights of the integrated data but also from sitting on an advisory governance board to guide the evolution of the cooperative.

### Open Skills Research Working Group

The Open Skills Research Working Group is dedicated to improving machine learning algorithms for translating workforce data into actionable insights about the dynamics of skills and jobs in the American economy. The Group is a made up of researchers from a variety of backgrounds, from economics to machine learning.

Data at Work hosts monthly researcher's calls to continue the conversation with researchers to better understand how our public datasets can be improved.
